1. pytz is supposed to be checked and installed before running. Though that is not the case. The program will still attempt to run without it. Evidence: requirements.txt /root/

2. In compat.py, time.clock is being used even though it may not be supported. Fix: change line 263 and 265 to try: and except:

3. AttributeError: module 'collections' has no attribute 'Hashable'.
  Fix:
    in constructor.py change lines 126-128 from:
      if not isinstance(key, collections.Hashable):
         raise ConstructorError("while constructing a mapping", node.start_mark,
                            "found unhashable key", key_node.start_mark)
    to:
      try:
          if not isinstance(key, collections.Hashable):
               raise ConstructorError("while constructing a mapping", node.start_mark,
                            "found unhashable key", key_node.start_mark)
      except:
          pass
